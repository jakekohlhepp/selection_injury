These programs replicate the paper Selection Against Injury Risk. The latest version of this paper is available here: https://www.jkohlhepp.com/publication/selection-injury/
To run these programs, simply download this repository and run master.do on Stata version 16. The master do file will automatically install the ssc packages unique and esttab, which are needed to replicate the paper. You will also need the main data file, which will be made public on jkohlhepp.com shortly. It should be placed in a new folder "mkdata/20170803_payworkers_comp/data/".
